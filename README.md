🧪 ChemLyrics — Periodic Table Style Lyrics Animator
Create lyric videos like never before. Mix Chemistry, Coding, Emojis, and Physics Symbols to make your lyrics explode with style.

<!-- Replace with a GIF or image of the tool in action -->

🚀 Features
🧬 Chemistry Mode: Words broken down into real periodic table elements (preferring two-letter symbols first, then one-letter).

❤️ Emoji Mode: Can’t find the element? Use expressive emojis for common words like love, fire, heart, dance.

🧲 Physics & Math Fallback: Still unmatched? Uses scientific unit symbols (like Ω, µ, Å, ℃) to fill every character gap.

✨ Block Style Rendering: Everything styled like a periodic table cell — element name, symbol, and atomic number.

⏱️ Timestamp Sync: Supports timed lyrics to generate animated visuals in sync with the music.

🎬 Example Output

Word: LOVE

→ [Li] [O] [V] [e⁻]

OR if not found in table:
→ ❤️  (emoji fallback)
Each word becomes a stack of stylish chemistry blocks with real or symbolic meaning!

🔧 How It Works
Input your lyrics and timestamps (optional).

The app parses each word.

For every word:

🔍 Check Emoji Map → if found, use emoji.

🧪 Match 2-letter Element Symbols → if matched, use.

🧪 Else, Match 1-letter Elements.

🧮 Fallback with Physics/Math Symbol Map.

Words are rendered vertically, preserving timestamp breaks.

Export animation.

💡 Why This Project?
"Topper se impress karne ke liye chemistry ki kitaab nahi, code likha."

From a nerdy backbencher to a coding chemist — this app was born out of heartbreak, topped with humor, and spiced with science.
